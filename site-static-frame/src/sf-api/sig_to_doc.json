An associated data-type object describes the format of each element in the array (its byte-order, how many bytes it occupies in memory, whether it is an integer, a floating point number, or something else, etc.) Arrays should be constructed using array, zeros or empty (refer to the See Also section below). The parameters given here refer to a low-level method (ndarray(...)) for instantiating an array. For more information, refer to the numpy module and examine the methods and attributes of an array. Parameters ---------- (for the __new__ method; see Notes below) shape : tuple of ints Shape of created array. dtype : data-type, optional Any object that can be interpreted as a numpy data type. buffer : object exposing buffer interface, optional Used to fill the array with data. offset : int, optional Offset of array data in buffer. strides : tuple of ints, optional Strides of data in memory. order : {'C', 'F'}, optional Row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order. Attributes ---------- T : ndarray Transpose of the array. data : buffer The array's elements, in memory. dtype : dtype object Describes the format of the elements in the array. flags : dict Dictionary containing information related to memory use, e.g., 'C_CONTIGUOUS', 'OWNDATA', 'WRITEABLE', etc. flat : numpy.flatiter object Flattened version of the array as an iterator. The iterator allows assignments, e.g., x.flat = 3 (See ndarray.flat for assignment examples; TODO). imag : ndarray Imaginary part of the array. real : ndarray Real part of the array. size : int Number of elements in the array. itemsize : int The memory use of each array element in bytes. nbytes : int The total number of bytes required to store the array data, i.e., itemsize * size. ndim : int The array's number of dimensions. shape : tuple of ints Shape of the array. strides : tuple of ints The step-size required to move from one element to the next in memory. For example, a contiguous (3, 4) array of type int16 in C-order has strides (8, 2). This implies that to move from element to element in memory requires jumps of 2 bytes. To move from row-to-row, one needs to jump 8 bytes at a time (2 * 4). ctypes : ctypes object Class containing properties of the array needed for interaction with ctypes. base : ndarray If the array is a view into another array, that array is its base (unless that array is also a view). The base array is where the array data is actually stored. See Also -------- array : Construct an array. zeros : Create an array, each element of which is zero. empty : Create an array, but leave its allocated memory unchanged (i.e., it contains \"garbage\"). dtype : Create a data-type. numpy.typing.NDArray : An ndarray alias :term:generic <generic type> w.r.t. its dtype.type <numpy.dtype.type>. Notes ----- There are two modes of creating an array using __new__: 1. If buffer is None, then only shape, dtype, and order are used. 2. If buffer is an object exposing the buffer interface, then all keywords are interpreted. No __init__ method is needed because the array is fully initialized after the __new__ method. Examples -------- These examples illustrate the low-level ndarray constructor. Refer to the See Also section above for easier ways of constructing an ndarray. First mode, buffer is None: >>> import numpy as np >>> np.ndarray(shape=(2,2), dtype=float, order='F') array([[0.0e+000, 0.0e+000], # random [ nan, 2.5e-323]]) Second mode: >>> np.ndarray((2,), buffer=np.array([1,2,3]), ... offset=np.int_().itemsize, ... dtype=int) # offset = 1*itemsize, i.e. skip first element array([2, 3])", "Series.interface": "A Frame documenting the interface of this class.", "Series.__repr__()": "", "Series.__str__()": "Return str(self).", "Series.display()": "Return a Display, capable of providing a string representation.

An associated data-type object describes the format of each element in the array (its byte-order, how many bytes it occupies in memory, whether it is an integer, a floating point number, or something else, etc.) Arrays should be constructed using array, zeros or empty (refer to the See Also section below). The parameters given here refer to a low-level method (ndarray(...)) for instantiating an array. For more information, refer to the numpy module and examine the methods and attributes of an array. Parameters ---------- (for the __new__ method; see Notes below) shape : tuple of ints Shape of created array. dtype : data-type, optional Any object that can be interpreted as a numpy data type. buffer : object exposing buffer interface, optional Used to fill the array with data. offset : int, optional Offset of array data in buffer. strides : tuple of ints, optional Strides of data in memory. order : {'C', 'F'}, optional Row-major (C-style) or column-major (Fortran-style) order. Attributes ---------- T : ndarray Transpose of the array. data : buffer The array's elements, in memory. dtype : dtype object Describes the format of the elements in the array. flags : dict Dictionary containing information related to memory use, e.g., 'C_CONTIGUOUS', 'OWNDATA', 'WRITEABLE', etc. flat : numpy.flatiter object Flattened version of the array as an iterator. The iterator allows assignments, e.g., x.flat = 3 (See ndarray.flat for assignment examples; TODO). imag : ndarray Imaginary part of the array. real : ndarray Real part of the array. size : int Number of elements in the array. itemsize : int The memory use of each array element in bytes. nbytes : int The total number of bytes required to store the array data, i.e., itemsize * size. ndim : int The array's number of dimensions. shape : tuple of ints Shape of the array. strides : tuple of ints The step-size required to move from one element to the next in memory. For example, a contiguous (3, 4) array of type int16 in C-order has strides (8, 2). This implies that to move from element to element in memory requires jumps of 2 bytes. To move from row-to-row, one needs to jump 8 bytes at a time (2 * 4). ctypes : ctypes object Class containing properties of the array needed for interaction with ctypes. base : ndarray If the array is a view into another array, that array is its base (unless that array is also a view). The base array is where the array data is actually stored. See Also -------- array : Construct an array. zeros : Create an array, each element of which is zero. empty : Create an array, but leave its allocated memory unchanged (i.e., it contains \"garbage\"). dtype : Create a data-type. numpy.typing.NDArray : An ndarray alias :term:generic <generic type> w.r.t. its dtype.type <numpy.dtype.type>. Notes ----- There are two modes of creating an array using __new__: 1. If buffer is None, then only shape, dtype, and order are used. 2. If buffer is an object exposing the buffer interface, then all keywords are interpreted. No __init__ method is needed because the array is fully initialized after the __new__ method. Examples -------- These examples illustrate the low-level ndarray constructor. Refer to the See Also section above for easier ways of constructing an ndarray. First mode, buffer is None: >>> import numpy as np >>> np.ndarray(shape=(2,2), dtype=float, order='F') array([[0.0e+000, 0.0e+000], # random [ nan, 2.5e-323]]) Second mode: >>> np.ndarray((2,), buffer=np.array([1,2,3]), ... offset=np.int_().itemsize, ... dtype=int) # offset = 1*itemsize, i.e. skip first element array([2, 3])", "SeriesHE.interface": "A Frame documenting the interface of this class.", "SeriesHE.__repr__()": "", "SeriesHE.__str__()": "Return str(self).", "SeriesHE.display()": "Return a Display, capable of providing a string representation.

For 2D containers, an iterable of strings must be of length equal to the columns (for a Frame) or the depth (for an Index Hierarchy); a mapping can use column labels (for a Frame) or depths (for an IndexHierarchy).", "IndexHierarchy.via_str.index()": "Like find, but raises ValueError when the substring is not found.", "IndexHierarchy.via_str.isalnum()": "Returns true for each element if all
